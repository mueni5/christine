### Front-end Setup
To run the front-end of the portfolio, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local system.
Navigate to the project root directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the development server. The front-end will be available at http://localhost:4000.
JSON Server Setup
The JSON server acts as a mock database for the portfolio project. It provides data for the projects and personal information displayed on the front-end.

To run the JSON server, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local system (if you haven't already).
Navigate to the db directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the JSON server. The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.
Data Management
The front-end interacts with the JSON server to fetch project data and personal information. Requests to the JSON server are made using Axios, and the data is displayed on the respective pages.
