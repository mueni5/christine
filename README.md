Tailwind CSS -  gives the app a professional appearance, Tailwind will allow us to easily apply multiple styles through combining classnames on our React elements.

### Setup

JSON Server Setup
The JSON server acts as a mock database for the portfolio project. It provides data for the projects and personal information displayed on the front-end.

To run the JSON server, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local system (if you haven't already).
Navigate to the directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the JSON server. The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Data Management
The front-end interacts with the JSON server to fetch project data and personal information. Requests to the JSON server are made using Axios, and the data is displayed on the respective pages.
